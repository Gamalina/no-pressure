# No Pressure

Welcome to the No Pressure website repository. This is a [React](https://react.dev/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project built on [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/), with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) available for use.

## Requirements

This project uses [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/), so to run one needs to meet the minimum requirements set forth there.

With that in mind, the currently known minimum requirements are:

* Node version 14.6.0

We recommend using the latest LTS versions.

## Getting started

Clone this repo using HTTPS, and navigate to the cloned folder. 

Inside the cloned folder, you must create a `.env` file which will contain the environment variables to use for this project. You can find an `.env.example` to show you which variables you will need. Then, simply ask a web dev over in #webdev-nerds to send you the correct values.

Once this is set up, you can run the following commands:
1. `npm ci` to install the node modules. 
2. `npm run dev` to run a local server.
